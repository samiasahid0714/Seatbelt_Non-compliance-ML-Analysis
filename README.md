# Seatbelt_Non-compliance-ML-Analysis

Data-driven analysis of seatbelt non-compliance using machine learning, SHAP-based explainability, and clustering. Identifies key risk factors and behavioral typologies from large-scale safety data. Supports evidence-based transportation safety policy and targeted interventions.

This project presents a data-driven behavioral safety analysis of seatbelt non-compliance using advanced machine learning and interpretable AI techniques. The study identifies key behavioral, demographic, and situational factors influencing unsafe seatbelt usage and uncovers hidden behavioral patterns among road users. The research integrates predictive modeling, explainable AI (SHAP), and unsupervised learning to generate policy-relevant insights for transportation safety improvement. This work was accepted for presentation at ICCESD 2026.
